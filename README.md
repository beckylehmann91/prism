# prism
Refracting color into sound

Our idea was simple. We strived to construct a web application that analyzes an image, and creates a musical piece that matches it. We achieved this goal through the use of countless algorithms that take advantage of inherent traits on a given image. Our front end design inspiration came from a strong desire to create something unconventional and different. Thus, PRISM was created. Now anyone can find their own sound and create what is quite literally the soundtrack of their life.

This project was built in Ruby on Rails, with selected pieces of jQuery and javascript sound libraries. It is the work of Chris Miklius, Becky Lehmann, Pratik Shah and Brian Wagner, as a final project for Dev Bootcamp.
